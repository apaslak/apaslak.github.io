Just your average human, trying to do more. Wrestling not being a morning person with trying to find more hours in the day _and_ get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Finding I can't do everything at once and settling for adding a few good things at a time. Life is a lot and you can't do it all, but I want to.

Growing up, the family computer was a BIG deal. It was the portal to a wealth of information and connections. It was a technology gateway drug, and I was hooked. I stumbled into programming in part because of sites like Neopets. I followed basic guides provided by the site and asked Jeeves everything else to style my user profile, shop, and guild page.

From there, I quickly learned I could build my _own_ website, with whatever content I desired. I began building websites as a means of collecting and sharing my passions with the world. At this point, programming wasn't about learning a skill or what I could do with it. It was simply what I could get from it: an endless well to dump information about my pre-teen obsessions.

Over time, computers and programming felt like art, puzzles that could be constructed to be aesthetically pleasing and functional. I graduated college with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology from Illinois Institute of Technology. I learned how to learn, and that programming for 12 hours straight was something I could do accidentally.

Now I'm just a professional googler with attention to detail, the foresight to write everything down, and a knack for picking up new things. The last 10 years have flown by, and I feel such privilege to have landed in a career that I not only enjoy, but also excel in.
