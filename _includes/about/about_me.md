Just your average human, trying to do more. Wrestling not being a morning person with trying to find more hours in the day and get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Finding I can't do everything at once and settling for adding a few good things at a time. Life is a lot and you can't do it all, but I want to.

My journey in tech began with a fascination for computers and their seemingly endless possibilities. What started as experimenting with website customization quickly evolved into a passion for programming. I've worn many hats in my tech journey - from crafting sleek user interfaces with JavaScript to diving into the depths of backend logic with Ruby on Rails (who doesn't love a good legacy Rails upgrade?). These days, you're more likely to find me in the Python/Django space, leading the charge as we juggle new features, technical debt, and occasionally play firefighter. Above all else, there's something deeply satisfying about diving into the core of systems and learning how they tick.

When I'm not immersed in code at work, you might find me working on personal projects that push my boundaries. Recently, I built a Go application that allows quick access to a GitHub repo's releases (just add "dl" after "github" in the URL – you're welcome!). I've also explored the internals of Jellyfin, a home media server, to add smart playlist functionality based on a video tagging system, and I'm using an old ThinkPad as a learning playground for Nix and Home Manager, all while juggling the endless projects that come with first-time homeownership. It's a delicate balance of professional growth, personal projects, and figuring out why that one light switch doesn't seem to do anything.

At my core, I’m just a professional googler with attention to detail, the foresight to write everything down, and a knack for picking up new things. The last 10 years have flown by, and I feel such privilege to have landed in a career that I not only enjoy, but also excel in.
