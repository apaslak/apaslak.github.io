Mars awakens to his sister trying to kill him. He kills her instead. It’s an accident. They say she just went crazy. But Mars knows his sister. She was not crazy. Something scared her. Something at Aspen, the prestigious summer camp in the woods that she ran all the way home from.

Now, Mars is going back to discover Aspen’s dark secrets for himself. Secrets guarded by a group of beautiful and terrifying girls known as the Honeys.

He’ll soon learn the things we must really fear are bold enough to hunt in the light.
