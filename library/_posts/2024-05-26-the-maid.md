Molly Gray is not like everyone else. She struggles with social skills and often misreads people’s intentions. But no matter—she still she throws herself with gusto into her work as a hotel maid at the five-star Regency Grand Hotel. She delights in donning her crisp uniform each morning and returning guest rooms to a state of perfection.

But Molly’s orderly life is upended when she enters the suite of the infamous and wealthy Charles Black, only to find Mr. Black dead—very dead—in his bed. Perplexed by Molly’s unusual behavior, the police immediately suspect her of murder. She’s soon caught in a web of deception with no idea how to untangle herself.

Fortunately for Molly, friends she never knew she had join her in a search for clues about what really happened to Mr. Black—but will they be able to find the real killer before it’s too late?
