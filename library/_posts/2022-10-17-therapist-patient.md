I've counseled the most chilling criminals... A young inmate who fell in love with a pedophile. A man who intentionally infected strangers with HIV. A patient with an extremely unusual addiction. A sociopath who wanted to have a conscience. A conspiracy theorist who harassed victims of a terrorist attack.

And the patient who still haunts my dreams: A boy sold into human trafficking.

In these files, you'll learn about the the psychology behind the world's most dangerous criminals.

But you'll also learn about me -- and the worst thing I've ever done.
