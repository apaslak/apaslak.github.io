I haven't had a website since college, somewhere around 8 years ago, and it was a pitiful little thing I was required to build for one of my classes. I'd relinquished my graphic design aspirations in high school and by the time I came back around to it, my outdated knowledge and the pressure to do well overwhelmed me so that I didn't know where to start. I ended up building a very simple landing page with a few terribly designed buttons.

Over the last few years, I've had it in the back of my mind to start a blog of some kind, but I was never sure what I had to say. I've decided to build one anyway, and figure that part out later. I've recently realized how all-consuming my work has been, such that I don't feel like I work on side projects at all anymore. To start, I'm remedying this with this blog.

I decided to use Jekyll and Github pages because they are both things I've heard about but had never tried. I wanted something simple, but powerful, and I wanted to learn something.

Verdict so far? Project success.
