Recently, my company started rolling out a mandatory Diversity and Inclusion training. It was a 90 minute session that mainly focused on introducing a very open ended conversation about identity: how we all have things we identify as or with, how those identities can be expressed, how that expression can be voluntary or involuntary, and how those expressions can be perceived by others. 

Mostly I walked out of the training realizing how very lucky I am to have landed where I am, at the time that I did. I joined Venmo about 3 months ago, and the last 6 months for the company has been explosive for growing the Chicago office. Nearly everyone I work with day-to-day is pretty new, and I'm realizing that what this means is there was no culture to assimilate into because we're still making it. Everyone is just showing up as they are, meeting people where they are. We're building a culture of openness and communication, and it feels <i>so</i> good. It's an amazing opportunity, and I'm so happy to be here for it.
