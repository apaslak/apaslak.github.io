Algorithms are wild. I never really learned them properly because... Well, I guess I never had to. I interviewed at companies that didn't ask DSA questions and it didn't seem to hold me back. I never really understood the value of studying DSA because its rarely applicable past interviews, but I'm beginning to understand now. 

In my spare time, I've been studying and it's been really interesting and fun. It feels good to understand new (to me) ways of thinking about problems. I generally consider my time in college as where I learned how to think and learn, not where I learned x or y. Learning DSA feels like that. The value is only a little bit the actual algorithms you learn. The rest is just learning to think differently. 

I'm not really sure why I decided to go this route but I'm happy I did.
